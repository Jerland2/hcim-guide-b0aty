HCIM Guide v1.0 (70 Herblore Brickwall)
Tpapa created this guide & I stole it and created it to try and be as non-competitive as possible with other players to hopefully prevent early bottlenecking. It is a Ironman/HCIM route to Song of the Elves completion with little downtime for 70 herblore. We also complete Recipe for Disaster, Perilous Moons, Royal Titans & maybe Piety

## 📜 **Throughout play ALL lamps go to Herblore
If the guide mentions 'Continue/Continue until/Complete X quest, you can start a quest helper for this quest and follow as directed. There is a LOT of multi-questing so you will be ignoring Quest Helper a lot**

### ✅ **Checklist:**
-Main account alt recommended but not required for any step 
Do all Random Events except: Maze, Mime, Camo & Gravedigger
-This guide DOES NOT include any LMS but if you enjoy LMS and enjoy PvP or want to learn a bit, I HEAVILY advise going to LMS at 750 total and getting Rune Arrows to Alch while questing. 
I would heavily recommend the 'Timers' plug in. You want to do a Farm Run & Bird House run almost any time you are withdrawing new gear for the next step if they are ready. IT IS NOT WORTH teleporting out of slayer tasks and mid quest to do these. 
- Keep 2x Seeds in Seed Vault at all times for contracts. Only do a herb run when you have a surplus of 5-6 seeds

As there is a hard 70 Agility requirement for Song of the Elves, it is extremely efficient to get this completed as soon as possible even though agility sucks as you will then have improved energy restoration, Graceful & 1M+ Coins from Agility Pyramid before starting. You will have to get 70 Agility anyway and the methods don't viably improve. Some optional methods to make early fast GP on accounts this guide doesn't mention:
- Early revenants (initial 100k required)
- 1+1 Soulwars (40 combat requirement)
- LMS Rune Arrows (750 total req+30QP req)
- Blackjacking with Rogue Outfit
- Agility Pyramid
- Eclipse Red's 

Upon creating your account, DO NOT choose a username with the words or phrases ‘Iron’ ‘HC’ ‘Fe’, 'GIM', 'GIMP'. This is the most important step of the guide.
- Use all Lamps on Herblore after quest is complete unless specified
- A lot of the time the guide will assume you have combat gear on you. Sometimes it is specified, sometimes it is not. I would always have a weapon/ammunition on you to kill monsters. Magic solves almost every fight except for Black Knight Titan

Medium Farming Contracts are excellent for Irit seeds. Song of the Elves has a hard requirement of 70 herblore so you will want to complete as many Farming contracts as necessary. Use CIR Fairy ring to return to Farming Guild. Thieve Master Farmers whenever you need seeds. You will probably complete every step on this guide and still not have 70 Herblore so upkeeping contracts is extremely important to prevent a bottleneck.
- Plant Hespori asap with Garden Pie.
- Farm Limpwurts everytime you return (you need 20 for Temple of Ikov)
Medium preplant is Maple, Irit, Cactus, Jangerberries, Watermelon, Limpwurt

70 Farming - Should be completed passively.

70 Herblore - This is still the huge problem. Skilling for Hard Diaries, While Guthix Sleeps & Sins of the Father are decent rewards but require some training which is the guide below. Simply maintain all your herb runs & medium contracts while playing the game beyond this point.

Buy 27 Butterfly Jars from Imia North-East
Go down the stairs and catch Moonlight Moths to the South
- Moonlight Moths restore 22 prayer per inventory slot and you can catch over 400/hour so these are excellent early game prayer
Catch as many as you want but 400 is an excellent start. Feel free to be sneaky and catch 1,000
Use Dashing Kebbit meat on Moonlight Moths to double the restore to 44 per inventory slot (You can optional hunt more if you want)

Withdraw: Teleport Runes, Range gear & Chinchompas, Pickaxe

Start Defender of Varrock until you unlock the Armoured Zombies
- Don't complete the quest. You can use the 2 Armoured Zombies instances to chin in peace
Throw all the chinchompas at Armoured Zombies. You probably won't get the Zombie axe but if 800 people follow this guide, statistically 1 of them will get the axe first KC. Optional to chin defensive but hitpoints would be better prioritised. 
- Pick up everything that looks useful

## 📜 **We now want to start working on Melee stats for Perilous Moons. You can afk crabs if you want for this. 
- Sulphur Naguas -> Fastest but no slayer XP but you can burst slayer if you want
- Slayer -> Work on 58/69 for Black Mask/MM2
- AFK Ammonite crabs
Stats we want: 65 Attack [Zombie Axe] 65 Strength [Warrior Guild entrance] 65 Defence [Kings Ransom] Train defence after 65/65 in warriors guild and beyond
Gear to unlock whenever you feel comfortable to toad
- Fire Cape (I melee mine with Dragon Scimitar; can always get mixed hide cape as a back up if you want range gear. We don't train range for a while
- Fighter Torso (optional, replaced by Blood Moon Chestplate so can be skipped. Mixed hide is +2)
- Obsidian Legs (optional, buyable but also replaced by Blood Moon Tassets)
- Berserker Helmet (buy from Fremennik, until Black Mask)
- Dragon Defender at 65/65
- Berserker Ring (optional); Imbue this at Soul Wars/PvP Arena/Nightmare Zone**

Once you are 65/65/65

Complete Kings Ransom
Complete Knight Waves (Flinch)

We are now going to do some Barrows. There are many ways to get there so choose which you want or unlock it before starting. We are only after tank gear so probably don't need to do much more than 100 chests. Use Wind Wave. Morytania hard for more runes is locked behind 70 prayer so not worth doing at this stage. 
- 80 Magic -> Magic Essence potion to 83 and make a Barrows portal in POH
- Salve Graveyard portal (Home teleport, recharge prayer on altar/pool, take salve graveyard portal->BKR fairy ring->Boat to barrows)

Once you have a Tank Helm/Plate/Legs you can use the excess Death & Chaos Runes to burst more Armoured Zombies to attempt Zombie axe. Burst on Defensive towards 70 Defence. We now need the Zombie axe before continuing so stay until you get it. Earning money and buying runes to burst is excellent as Magic levels are great for Corrupted Gauntlet and this is the best KPH & hitpoints xp/hour right now so very efficient even if you have to detour earning gold.

Once you have 70 Defence & Zombie Axe
- Complete Twilights Promise
- Complete Perilous Moons

Camp Perilous Moons until 63 Prayer worth from the rewards (30+ hours)
- Blood moon is a bit tedious but Food+Potions are obtained for free inside the dungeon
- Stay until Eclipse Atlatl (If you got Karils bow from Barrows you can leave this)
OPTIONAL: Stay until Full Eclipse

Once 63 Prayer and Eclipse unlocked
Kill Royal Titans until Mystic Vigour (Loot the Fire Giant)
- These are 0 damage if you use Water/Fire Wave on the Elementals and kill both giants roughly at the same time so very safe on HCIM

This is now a comfortable point to get your Enhanced Weapon Seed from Corrupted Gauntlet with Tier 3 Preparation. It is best to 5:1 with magic still but your Hitpoints will be 75+ at this point

If you have made it this far. Type WAWA in chat
